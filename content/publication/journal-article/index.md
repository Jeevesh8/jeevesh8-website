abstract: Identifying argument components from unstructured texts and predicting
  the relationships expressed among them are two primary steps of argument
  mining. The intrinsic complexity of these tasks demands powerful learning
  models. While pretrained Transformer-based Language Models (LM) have been
  shown to provide state-of-the-art results over different NLP tasks, the
  scarcity of manually annotated data and the highly domain-dependent nature of
  argumentation restrict the capabilities of such models. In this work, we
  propose a novel transfer learning strategy to overcome these challenges. We
  utilize argumentation-rich social discussions from the ChangeMyView subreddit
  as a source of unsupervised, argumentative discourse-aware knowledge by
  finetuning pretrained LMs on a selectively masked language modeling task.
  Furthermore, we introduce a novel prompt-based strategy for inter-component
  relation prediction that compliments our proposed finetuning method while
  leveraging on the discourse context. Exhaustive experiments show the
  generalization capability of our method on these two tasks over within-domain
  as well as out-of-domain datasets, outperforming several existing and employed
  strong baselines.
